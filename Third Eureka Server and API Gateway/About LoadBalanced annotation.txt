Load balancing is the process of distributing traffic among different instances of the same application. To create a fault-tolerant system (system remains available, reliable, and functional even in case of hardware or software failures, environmental disturbances, or other unexpected events), it's common to run multiple instances of each application. Thus, whenever one service needs to communicate with another, it needs to pick a particular instance to send its request.

"@LoadBalanced" annotation allows you to use "logical identifiers" ( "CONTACTSERVICE" in our example) for the URLs you pass to the RestTemplate. These logical identifiers are typically the names of a services.
