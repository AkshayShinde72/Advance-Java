here "-id" can be any name
uri must be name of the microservice shown in the "status" section on http://localhost:8761/   page  (UserService in this case)
Path - /user/**
	means that when user types
http://localhost:8999/user/<anything>
	invoke "UserServicePro" microservice

so when we type
	http://localhost:8999/user/101
		it gives us details of the user which has an id 101 from "UserServicePro" microservice.
