@SpringBootApplication should be applied to that class which is going to start the server and deploy your web application.

Spring Boot @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning. It's same as declaring a class with @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan annotations.

i.e

SpringBootApplication=Configuration+EnableAutoConfiguration+ComponentScan




@Configuration : This annotation indicates that the class is a configuration class and can contain Spring bean definitions. It is used to define and configure beans that are managed by the Spring framework. 

@EnableAutoConfiguration : This annotation enables automatic configuration of the Spring Boot application.
