In Spring Boot, the creation of the BeanFactory and ApplicationContext is typically handled by the Spring framework itself, and you don't need to explicitly create them in your application code. The framework provides a mechanism for automatic configuration (@EnableAutoConfiguration) and component scanning, which allows it to discover and instantiate beans based on certain conventions.
