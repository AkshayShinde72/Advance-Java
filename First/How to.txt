	new
		Spring starter project

give a name to the project "MVC"

make sure Type is "Maven" and "Java version is 17"

next

make sure spring boot version is "3.0.8 snapshot"

new spring starter project dependencies

	choose

		Spring Web
		Thymeleaf

next
	finish


once the project gets created,

copy "Book.java" and "BookNewController.java" in the same package where "DemoApplication.java" has been created.


since we don't maintain "spring bean configuration file" inside spring boot, "View Resolver" settings we have to write inside "application.properties" file as follows:

spring.mvc.view.prefix="/"
spring.mvc.view.suffix=".html"   or ".jsp"

html 
	in case if our view is "thymeleaf"

jsp
	in case our view is "JSP"

both ".html" or ".jsp" file needs to be there inside 
	"src/main/resources/templates" folder.

since we have "html(thymeleaf)" as a view, following entries should be there inside "application.properties" file:

in case of Spring boot application, 
	"application.properties" file gets created inside
	"src/main/resources" folder


spring.mvc.view.prefix="/"
spring.mvc.view.suffix=".html"


save "application.properties" file.


copy "success.html" and "bookNew.html" inside  "src/main/resources/templates"  folder.



go to "@SpringBootApplication" java class
	run as
		java application

make sure server starts successfully

go to browser and type

http://localhost:8080/book

and make sure application works properly.
